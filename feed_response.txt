As such, OpenAI engineers hope that the AI model will produce better responses to complex prompts instead of jumping to a faulty conclusion.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nIt appears to have worked, at least to some degree. In its most powerful \"high-compute mode,\" o3 scored 87.5 percent on the ARC-AGI benchmark designed to test language models, according to the test's creator François Chollet. That's nearly three times as high as the previous o1 model's best score, at just 32 percent.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nAll that fastidious thinking, however, comes with exorbitant expenses. To achieve that high-water mark, o3 used well over $1,000 of computing power per task — over 170 times more compute than a low-power version of o3, and leagues beyond its predecessor, which cost less than $4 per task.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nWall to Wall⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nThese costs complicate the industry's claims that o3's performance soundly debunks fears that improving AI models through \"scaling,\" or by furnishing them with more processing power and training data, has hit a wall.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nOn the one hand, that o3 scored nearly three times higher than o1, which was released just three months ago, seems ample evidence that AI gains aren't slowing down.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nBut the criticism with scaling is that it yields diminishing returns. While the gains here were in large part achieved through changing how the AI model \"reasons\" instead of scaling alone, the added costs are difficult to ignore.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nEven the low-compute version of o3, which scored a still breakthrough-worthy 76 percent on the benchmark, cost around $20 per task. That's a relative bargain, but still many times more expensive than its predecessors — and with ChatGPT Plus costing just $25 per month, it's not clear how much smarter that user-facing product will be able to get without putting OpenAI deeply in the red.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nHigh Salary⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nIn a blog post explaining the benchmark results, Chollet asserts that though o3 is approaching human levels of performance, it \"comes at a steep cost, and wouldn't quite be economical yet.\"⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\n\"You could pay a human to solve ARC-AGI tasks for roughly $5 per task (we know, we did that),\" he wrote, \"while consuming mere cents in energy.\"⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nHe is adamant, however, that \"cost-performance will likely improve quite dramatically over the next few months and years.\"⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nAnd to that, we'll just have to wait and see.
